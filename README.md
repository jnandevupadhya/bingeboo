# 🍿 **BingeBoo — Watch together, even when you’re apart.**

> Made for fun ❤️ · Not affiliated with Netflix

Hey!

**BingeBoo** is a small side project I built to make long-distance binge sessions feel less… long-distance.  
It’s basically a **remote control for Netflix**, but shared — one person hosts, the other joins, and both stay perfectly in sync.

No screen sharing.  
No streaming content around.  
Just syncing *playback state* — like play, pause, rewind, and forward.

Simple, cozy, and made for chill watch nights. 🌙

## 🛋️ The Idea

You know that moment when you’re watching something with someone on call and you go:

> “Wait—pause. Okay play. No no rewind 10 seconds.”

Yeah.  
BingeBoo exists to kill that chaos.

One person creates a **room**, shares the **room code**, and the other person joins using the app.  
From there, both of you control playback using just **three simple buttons** — and Netflix stays in sync.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

BingeBoo does **not** stream, share, or modify Netflix content in any way.  
It only syncs **playback state** (play, pause, seek) between users.

This project was built purely for **learning and personal use**.  
Please use it responsibly and at your own discretion.

## 🌙 Final Thoughts

BingeBoo isn’t a product or startup; just a cozy little project that makes watching together easier.

If it helps you avoid the constant   “wait—play—pause—rewind” loop, then it’s done its job.

Happy bingeing 🍿
